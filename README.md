# Metaversus
The metaverse is a network of shared, immersive virtual worlds where people can connect with friends, create and play games, work and shop. You can think of the metaverse as a cyberspace, or an evolved, three-dimensional internet where logging in isnâ€™t necessary. It may also incorporate elements of virtual and augmented reality.
